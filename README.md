## Group Dynamic Interview
 * Pick 3 most important adjectives to describe the role/position and why (explain the reasoning behind)
 * Share with other candidates - make a decision on finalizing the major 3
 * Write SQL queries - need to brush up on that
 * ERPsuite or not, that is the question - make a slide to present with diagrams/graphs
 * Learn Qlik
 * How to communicate / collaborate with others - when we have different opionions, how do we convince one another, negotiate, agree on terms, and decide what is the best


## Technical

### Java

* What is the difference between Do While loop and While Loop? 
While loop executes the code block only if the condition is True. In Java Do While loop, condition is tested at the end of the loop so Do While executes the statements in the code block at least once even if the condition Fails.

* What is the variable for small whole number ? => SHORT 
short: The short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -32,768 and a maximum value of 32,767 (inclusive).

* What are primitives in Java?
Primitive types are the most basic data types available within the Java language. There are 8: boolean , byte , char , short , int , long , float and double . These types serve as the building blocks of data manipulation in Java. Such types serve only one purpose â€” containing pure, simple values of a kind.

- BigInt is not a primitive, it's a library / BigDecimal

*  What is the purpose of method? - Reusability

* Finding the number of ways from point A to B - Using Dijakstra Algorithm 
+ thoughtworks trains problem

* Code Challenge - The first line of the input contains an integer N - the number of elements in the array. 1 <= N <= 10. The second line of the input contains N integers - the elements of the array, separated with single spaces. 1 <= ai <= 10. 
 Math.abs(arr[i] - arr[i+1]) <= 1

- You have N boxes in your room which you want to carry to a different place. There are too many to carry in one trip, so you want to split them into several piles using the following algorithm: if the current pile has at most M boxes, you can carry it as is, otherwise you split it into P parts as equally as possible (i.e. so that the sizes of the parts differ at most by 1) and apply the same algorithm to each of the parts. If you're trying to split less than P boxes into P piles, discard resulting zero-sized piles (see example 2).
